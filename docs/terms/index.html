    <h1>Terms of Service</h1>
    <p class="meta"><strong>Forged</strong> &nbsp;·&nbsp; Effective Date: January 1, 2026 &nbsp;·&nbsp; Yellow Bike Studio</p>

    <div class="lede">
      These terms are written in plain language. We aim to be fair, clear, and straightforward.
    </div>

    <h2>1. Acceptance of Terms</h2>
    <p>By downloading, installing, or using the Forged application ("App"), you agree to be bound by these Terms of Service ("Terms"). If you do not agree, please do not use the App. Continued use constitutes ongoing acceptance.</p>

    <hr />

    <h2>2. About the App</h2>
    <p>Forged is a personal productivity application developed by Yellow Bike Studio ("we," "our," "us") and designed to run on your device. All user data is stored locally on your device or in your personal cloud storage account (Apple iCloud or Google backup). Forged does not operate servers that store your personal data.</p>

    <hr />

    <h2>3. License</h2>
    <p>We grant you a personal, non-exclusive, non-transferable, revocable license to use the App on devices you own or control, solely for your personal, non-commercial use. This license does not permit you to:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Copy, modify, or distribute the App or any part of it</li>
      <li>Reverse engineer, decompile, or disassemble the App</li>
      <li>Sublicense, sell, rent, or transfer the App or your rights under these Terms</li>
      <li>Use the App to build a competing product or service</li>
    </ul>

    <hr />

    <h2>4. Your Content and Data</h2>
    <p>You own all content and data you create within the App ("Your Content"). Yellow Bike Studio claims no rights over it whatsoever.</p>
    <p>Because Your Content is stored on your device and in your personal cloud account, you are solely responsible for:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Maintaining backups of Your Content</li>
      <li>The security of your device and cloud storage credentials</li>
      <li>Any content you choose to share outside the App</li>
    </ul>
    <p>We are not liable for loss of Your Content due to device failure, deletion, loss of account access, or any other cause.</p>

    <hr />

    <h2>5. Acceptable Use</h2>
    <p>You agree to use the App only for lawful purposes and in accordance with these Terms. You agree not to:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Violate any applicable law or regulation</li>
      <li>Store or transmit any content that is illegal, harmful, or infringes the rights of others</li>
      <li>Attempt to interfere with or disrupt the App's security or functionality</li>
      <li>Use the App in any way that could damage or impair its operation</li>
    </ul>

    <hr />

    <h2>6. App Store Terms</h2>
    <p>The App is distributed through the Apple App Store and Google Play Store. Your download and use are also subject to the terms of the relevant store. Where those terms conflict with ours, store terms govern the distribution relationship; our Terms govern your use of the App itself.</p>

    <hr />

    <h2>7. Purchases</h2>
    <p>If the App offers in-app purchases, all payments are processed by Apple or Google through their respective platforms. Yellow Bike Studio does not collect or store payment information of any kind.</p>
    <p>All purchases are final unless the applicable store's refund policy or applicable law provides otherwise. For purchase issues, contact the relevant app store directly.</p>

    <hr />

    <h2>8. Disclaimers</h2>
    <p><strong>THE APP IS PROVIDED "AS IS" AND "AS AVAILABLE"</strong> without warranties of any kind, express or implied, including but not limited to implied warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, and non-infringement.</p>
    <p>We do not warrant that the App will be uninterrupted, error-free, or that defects will be corrected. Because your data is stored locally, we make no warranties regarding data retention or recovery. You are responsible for your own backups.</p>

    <hr />

    <h2>9. Limitation of Liability</h2>
    <p><strong>TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW,</strong> Yellow Bike Studio shall not be liable for any indirect, incidental, special, or consequential damages, including loss of data, revenue, or goodwill, arising from your use of or inability to use the App.</p>
    <p>Our total liability to you for any claim shall not exceed the amount you paid for the App in the twelve (12) months preceding the claim.</p>

    <hr />

    <h2>10. Indemnification</h2>
    <p>You agree to indemnify and hold harmless Yellow Bike Studio and its developers from any claims, damages, losses, and costs (including reasonable legal fees) arising out of your use of the App, your violation of these Terms, or your infringement of any third-party rights.</p>

    <hr />

    <h2>11. Changes to the App and Terms</h2>
    <p>We may update the App or these Terms at any time. Material changes to the Terms will be communicated via an in-App notice or update. Continued use after a change constitutes acceptance of the updated Terms.</p>

    <hr />

    <h2>12. Termination</h2>
    <p>These Terms remain in effect until terminated. You may terminate at any time by deleting the App. We may suspend or terminate your license immediately if you breach these Terms. Because your data is stored locally, there is nothing for us to return or delete upon termination.</p>

    <hr />

    <h2>13. Governing Law</h2>
    <p>These Terms are governed by the laws of the United States. Disputes that cannot be resolved through good-faith negotiation will be submitted to binding arbitration under the rules of the American Arbitration Association. You waive any right to participate in a class action.</p>

    <hr />

    <h2>14. General</h2>
    <p><strong>Entire Agreement.</strong> These Terms and our Privacy Policy form the complete agreement between you and Yellow Bike Studio regarding the App.</p>
    <p><strong>Severability.</strong> If any provision is found unenforceable, the rest of these Terms remain in effect.</p>
    <p><strong>Waiver.</strong> Failure to enforce any provision is not a waiver of our right to enforce it later.</p>
    <p><strong>Assignment.</strong> You may not assign these Terms without our consent. We may assign our rights without restriction.</p>

    <hr />
