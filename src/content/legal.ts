**Forged** | Effective Date: January 1, 2026

---

> *The short version: Forged never sees your data. It lives on your device and your personal cloud storage only. We have nothing to sell, nothing to share, and nothing to breach.*

---

## 1. Introduction

Thank you for using Forged. This Privacy Policy describes how Yellow Bike Studio ("we," "our," "us") handles information in connection with the Forged mobile application ("App"). We designed Forged with a straightforward privacy principle: your data belongs to you, lives with you, and never passes through our hands.

Please read this policy carefully. Because our data practices are minimal by design, this document is intentionally brief.

---

## 2. Information We Collect

### 2.1 What Stays on Your Device

Everything you create or configure in Forged — your content, settings, and preferences — is stored locally on your device. It never leaves your device except through the cloud sync you choose to enable (see Section 3).

### 2.2 What We Do Not Collect

Forged does not collect, transmit, or store any of the following:

- Your name, email address, or any identifying information
- Your location
- Device identifiers or advertising IDs
- Usage analytics or behavioral data
- Any content you create within the App
- Crash logs or diagnostics that identify you
- Cookies or tracking data of any kind

### 2.3 No Account Required

Forged requires no account, no login, and no personal information to use. We never ask who you are.

---

## 3. Cloud Storage (iCloud & Android Backup)

If you choose to enable cloud sync, your data is saved to your personal cloud storage account — Apple iCloud on iOS/macOS, or Google's backup service on Android. This is your storage account, governed by Apple's and Google's own privacy policies.

- Your cloud data is encrypted at rest and in transit by Apple and Google.
- We — the Yellow Bike Studio team — have zero access to your cloud data.
- You can disable cloud sync at any time through your device's settings.
- Deleting the App removes all local data from your device. Disable cloud backup before deletion if you also want to remove cloud copies.

---

## 4. Third-Party Services

Forged contains no advertising SDKs, data brokers, or social media trackers. The only third parties involved in your experience are:

- **Apple App Store / Google Play Store** — for App distribution
- **Apple iCloud / Google Backup** — only if you enable cloud sync
- **Operational tools** — we use third-party tools for debugging, logging, and analytics to help us maintain and improve the App. Any data collected through these tools is strictly operational in nature (e.g., crash frequency, performance metrics) and does not include personally identifiable information (PII). It cannot be used to identify you.

All third-party services are governed by their own privacy policies, which we encourage you to review.

---

## 5. Data Security

The most secure server is one that doesn't exist. Because Forged never transmits your personal data to our infrastructure, there is no Yellow Bike Studio server to breach, no database to leak, and no credentials of yours to steal.

When cloud sync is enabled, your data benefits from Apple's and Google's enterprise-grade encryption and security infrastructure.

---

## 6. Children's Privacy

Because Forged collects no personal information from anyone, it presents no data-privacy risk to users of any age, including children under 13.

---

## 7. Your Rights

Because your data is stored on your device and in your personal cloud account, you have full control:

- **Access:** View all your data directly in the App or your device storage.
- **Deletion:** Delete any or all data within the App, or by uninstalling it.
- **Portability:** Your data is on your device — you own and control it entirely.
- **Correction:** Edit any data you've created directly in the App.

There is no server-side process for these requests because we hold nothing on our end.

---

## 8. Changes to This Policy

If we make material changes to this Privacy Policy, we will update the effective date above and notify you via an App update notice. Our core commitment — not collecting your data — is a design decision, not just a policy statement. Any updates are very unlikely to expand our data practices.

  terms: {
    title: 'Terms of Service',
    body: `# Terms of Service

**Forged** | Effective Date: January 1, 2026

---

> *These terms are written in plain language. We aim to be fair, clear, and straightforward.*

---

## 1. Acceptance of Terms

By downloading, installing, or using the Forged application ("App"), you agree to be bound by these Terms of Service ("Terms"). If you do not agree, please do not use the App. Continued use constitutes ongoing acceptance.

---

## 2. About the App

Forged is a personal productivity application developed by Yellow Bike Studio ("we," "our," "us") and designed to run on your device. All user data is stored locally on your device or in your personal cloud storage account (Apple iCloud or Google backup). Forged does not operate servers that store your personal data.

---

## 3. License

We grant you a personal, non-exclusive, non-transferable, revocable license to use the App on devices you own or control, solely for your personal, non-commercial use. This license does not permit you to:

- Copy, modify, or distribute the App or any part of it
- Reverse engineer, decompile, or disassemble the App
- Sublicense, sell, rent, or transfer the App or your rights under these Terms
- Use the App to build a competing product or service

---

## 4. Your Content and Data

You own all content and data you create within the App ("Your Content"). Yellow Bike Studio claims no rights over it whatsoever.

Because Your Content is stored on your device and in your personal cloud account, you are solely responsible for:

- Maintaining backups of Your Content
- The security of your device and cloud storage credentials
- Any content you choose to share outside the App

We are not liable for loss of Your Content due to device failure, deletion, loss of account access, or any other cause.

---

## 5. Acceptable Use

You agree to use the App only for lawful purposes and in accordance with these Terms. You agree not to:

- Violate any applicable law or regulation
- Store or transmit any content that is illegal, harmful, or infringes the rights of others
- Attempt to interfere with or disrupt the App's security or functionality
- Use the App in any way that could damage or impair its operation

---

## 6. App Store Terms

The App is distributed through the Apple App Store and Google Play Store. Your download and use are also subject to the terms of the relevant store. Where those terms conflict with ours, store terms govern the distribution relationship; our Terms govern your use of the App itself.

---

## 7. Purchases and Subscriptions

If the App offers in-app purchases or subscriptions, all payments are processed by Apple or Google through their respective platforms. Yellow Bike Studio does not collect or store payment information of any kind.

All purchases are final unless the applicable store's refund policy or applicable law provides otherwise. For purchase issues, contact the relevant app store directly.

---

## 8. Disclaimers

**THE APP IS PROVIDED "AS IS" AND "AS AVAILABLE"** without warranties of any kind, express or implied, including but not limited to implied warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, and non-infringement.

We do not warrant that the App will be uninterrupted, error-free, or that defects will be corrected. Because your data is stored locally, we make no warranties regarding data retention or recovery. You are responsible for your own backups.

---

## 9. Limitation of Liability

**TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW,** Yellow Bike Studio shall not be liable for any indirect, incidental, special, or consequential damages, including loss of data, revenue, or goodwill, arising from your use of or inability to use the App.

Our total liability to you for any claim shall not exceed the amount you paid for the App in the twelve (12) months preceding the claim.

---

## 10. Indemnification

You agree to indemnify and hold harmless Yellow Bike Studio and its developers from any claims, damages, losses, and costs (including reasonable legal fees) arising out of your use of the App, your violation of these Terms, or your infringement of any third-party rights.

---

## 11. Changes to the App and Terms

We may update the App or these Terms at any time. Material changes to the Terms will be communicated via an in-App notice or update. Continued use after a change constitutes acceptance of the updated Terms.

---

## 12. Termination

These Terms remain in effect until terminated. You may terminate at any time by deleting the App. We may suspend or terminate your license immediately if you breach these Terms. Because your data is stored locally, there is nothing for us to return or delete upon termination.

---

## 13. Governing Law

These Terms are governed by the laws of the United States. Disputes that cannot be resolved through good-faith negotiation will be submitted to binding arbitration under the rules of the American Arbitration Association. You waive any right to participate in a class action.

---

## 14. General

**Entire Agreement.** These Terms and our Privacy Policy form the complete agreement between you and Yellow Bike Studio regarding the App.

**Severability.** If any provision is found unenforceable, the rest of these Terms remain in effect.

**Waiver.** Failure to enforce any provision is not a waiver of our right to enforce it later.

**Assignment.** You may not assign these Terms without our consent. We may assign our rights without restriction.

---

## 15. Contact
